    <div class="container">
        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>1. Agreement Overview</h2>
            <p>By booking or using our car rental services, you acknowledge and agree to the following Terms and Conditions. These Terms govern your use of our rental services, and by accepting them, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree to these terms, you should refrain from renting or using our services. We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time, and we recommend reviewing them periodically.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>2. Rental Period</h2>
            <p>The rental period begins when you pick up the vehicle and ends when the vehicle is returned to the agreed-upon drop-off location, as specified in your rental agreement. You are expected to return the vehicle on or before the date and time stated in your booking. If you are unable to return the vehicle on time, you must inform us in advance to avoid additional late charges. If the vehicle is not returned on time without prior notice, additional fees will be charged, and this may result in the cancellation of your booking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>3. Age Requirement</h2>
            <p>To rent a vehicle, the primary driver must be at least 21 years of age at the time of rental. Drivers aged 21-24 may be subject to an additional surcharge, often referred to as a “young driver fee.” Renters over the age of 70 may also be subject to additional charges or restrictions based on their driving history. Proof of age and a valid driver’s license are required at the time of rental. All drivers must hold a valid, non-expired driver’s license and have a minimum of one year of driving experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>4. Reservation & Payment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Booking Process:</strong> All bookings must be made through our official website or through approved booking agents. Once a reservation is made, the booking is confirmed upon receipt of full payment or an agreed-upon deposit.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> We accept payments via major credit cards, debit cards, or other secure online payment methods, such as PayPal or bank transfer.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Deposit:</strong> A security deposit is required at the time of rental. This deposit will be pre-authorized on your credit card and released upon the safe return of the vehicle, minus any charges for damages, late returns, or other fees.</li>
                <li><strong>Currency:</strong> All payments are processed in [your local currency]. Additional exchange rate or processing fees may apply if you are using a different currency.</li>
                <li><strong>Late Payments:</strong> In the event of non-payment, your reservation may be canceled, and additional collection fees may apply.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>5. Driver Requirements</h2>
            <p>The vehicle may only be driven by the primary renter and any additional authorized drivers listed in the rental agreement. Only drivers who are 21 years of age or older and who hold a valid driver’s license may operate the vehicle. You must ensure that any additional drivers are added to the rental agreement prior to the rental start. There is an additional fee for adding extra drivers. All drivers must present their valid driver’s licenses at the time of vehicle pick-up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>6. Insurance and Liability</h2>
            <p>We provide basic insurance coverage as part of your rental agreement. Optional additional insurance products include Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), Theft Protection (TP), and Personal Accident Insurance (PAI). If you decline additional coverage, you are responsible for any damage, theft, or loss of the vehicle during the rental period.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>7. Fuel Policy</h2>
            <p>The car is provided with a full tank of fuel. You are required to return the vehicle with a full tank of fuel. If the vehicle is returned with less fuel than it was rented with, you will be charged for the missing fuel at a higher rate, plus a refueling service charge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>8. Vehicle Condition</h2>
            <p>The vehicle will be inspected for damage at the time of pick-up and again upon return. Any damage to the vehicle, including body damage, tire damage, interior stains, and missing equipment, will incur a charge to cover repair or replacement costs. Smoking is prohibited inside the vehicle.</p>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>11. Cancellation and No-Show Policy</h2>
            <p>If you need to cancel your reservation, you may do so up to 48 hours before your scheduled pick-up time for a full refund. Cancellations made within 48 hours will incur a cancellation fee, and no-shows will be charged the full rental amount.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>12. Damage or Loss</h2>
            <p>The renter is responsible for all damages to the vehicle, including theft, vandalism, or accidents. You must immediately report any damage or loss, and a police report may be required.</p>
